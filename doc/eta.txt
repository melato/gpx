Expected Time of Arrival at a stop


- compute current location on the route (distance from start)
- compute remaining distance D
- compute speed for the last 5 minutes (or from the beginning, etc.) V
- ETA = now + D/V

- to compute current position of q on the path.
  - find 2 closest stops, S1 < S2
  - Project current position, q on the line going through S1, S2
  - Compute P1, distance from S1 to X.
  - Compute D, distance from q to the line S1, S2
  - Accept the result if D is less than a threshold (100 m)

- coordinate transformation computation:
  - use a coordinate system centered at q (convert lat, lon degrees to meters)
  - rotate coordinates so that y(S1) = y(S2).
  - D is y(S2), P = -x(S1)

- heuristic computation:
  - compute d1 = distance(q, S1), d2 = distance(q, S2), s = distance(S1, S2)
    - if d1 < s and d2 < s, q is between S1, S2.  P = s * d1 / (d1+d2)
	- if s < d1 < d2, q is beyond S2.  P = s + d1 - d2
	- if s < d2 < d1, q is before S1.  P = d2 - d1
